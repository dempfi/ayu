Welcome to new major version of ayu with support to all new features of
Sublime Text 3.

   you'll always have all icons up to date.

2. Support for titlebar on macOs

3. Improved overall contrast

4. Support for native font if you don't like monospaced one.
   Just add `ui_font_default: true` to your settings

5. New activation command, now in order to activate any of ayu themes, you can
   just go to `Tools > Command Palette` (or CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + p) and type
   `ayu: Activate theme`.

Keep tuned folks, more features are comming.
